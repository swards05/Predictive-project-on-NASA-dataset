Project Workflow Topics

Project Setup

Folder structure, libraries, requirements.

Data Loading

Load train_FD001.txt, test_FD001.txt, RUL_FD001.txt.

Assign column names (engine_id, cycle, settings, sensors).

Data Exploration

Head, shape, missing values.

Plots: sensor trends, correlation heatmap, RUL histogram.

Data Preprocessing

Compute RUL for train & test.

Drop constant sensors.

Feature Engineering

Add derived features (rate of change, rolling mean/std, etc.).

Windowing (optional, if you want sequence features).

Scaling

Apply StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler.

Train/Test Split

Split by engine IDs (avoid leakage).

Model Training

GradientBoostingRegressor (baseline).

Optionally compare with XGBoost/LightGBM.

Hyperparameter Tuning

GridSearchCV or Optuna.

Evaluation Metrics

RMSE, MAE, R².

Compare predicted RUL vs true RUL plots.

Alert System

Define threshold (e.g., RUL ≤ 30 → Alert).

Generate alerts per engine.

Data Visualization

Predicted vs true RUL.

Engine health timeline with alert flags.

Feature importance plot.

Model Interpretation

Which sensors/settings are most important?

Deployment & GitHub Structure

Save models, outputs, visualizations.

Organize into src/, data/, notebooks/.

README Documentation

Dataset description, methodology, results, visualizations.

Extensions (optional)

Classification (Fail soon/Not fail soon).

Deep learning (LSTM/GRU).

Experiment Tracking (optional)

Track results with MLflow or just a CSV log.

Reproducibility

Fix random seeds, export requirements.txt.
